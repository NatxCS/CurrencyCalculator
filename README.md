# Currency Exchange Rates App

Welcome to the Currency Exchange Rates app, this Flutter-based mobile application allows users to quickly check currency exchange rates and perform unit conversions using a built-in calculator (**under development**). This app is designed to demonstrate my Android development skills and passion for creating intuitive, practical solutions.

Please note that this app currently utilizes the free version of the AppExchange API, which may not provide up-to-date rates.

## Features

- Access currency exchange rates using the ExchangeRate-API.
- Explore rates for a wide range of international currencies.
- User-friendly interface for inputting values and selecting units.
